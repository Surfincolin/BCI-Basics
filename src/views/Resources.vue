		</h3>
		<p>
    Python is my programming language of choice for working with data in general. Whether you are new to python or a seasoned developer, this online book is excellent! It covers everything from the basics of how to use python but focuses on numerical methods as the name implies. What that means is that the book covers more practical topics like how to program derivatives or implement your own Fourier Transform. The book has a convenient table of contents to navigate and can be downloaded for offline consumption.
